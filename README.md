6. **CI/CD Configuration:** Scripts and workflows for automated testing and deployment.

### Version Control with Git

**Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?**

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes.

**Git Concepts:**
- **Commits:** Snapshots of changes made to the repository.
- **Branches:** Independent lines of development.
- **Merges:** Combining changes from different branches.

**GitHub Enhancements:**
- **Remote Repository Hosting:** Central place to push and pull code from.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Pull requests, code reviews, and inline comments.
- **History and Backup:** Keeps a record of all changes and backups on GitHub servers.
- **Access Control:** Manage who can read or modify the repository.

### Branching and Merging in GitHub

**What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.**

Branches in GitHub allow developers to create separate environments for working on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. This promotes parallel development and easy integration of changes.

**Process:**
1. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
   Or via GitHub UI: Go to the repository, click on the branch dropdown, and type a new branch name.

2. **Make Changes:** Edit files, add commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```

3. **Push Branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request:** On GitHub, compare & pull request your branch into the main branch.

5. **Review and Merge:**
   - **Review:** Team members review the changes.
   - **Merge:** Once approved, merge the pull request via GitHub interface.

### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

**What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.**

A pull request (PR) is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bug fix and request that it be merged into the main codebase. It allows for discussion, review, and modification of code before merging.

**Creating a Pull Request:**
1. Push the changes to a branch on GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
3. Click on "Pull requests" and then "New pull request."
4. Choose the branch you want to merge from and into.
5. Fill in the PR details: title, description, and any relevant comments.
6. Submit the pull request.

**Reviewing a Pull Request:**
1. Navigate to the "Pull requests" section in the repository.
2. Select the PR to review.
3. Examine the changes, add comments, suggest changes, or approve the PR.
4. Once all reviews are addressed, merge the PR.

### GitHub Actions

**Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.**

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository. You can create workflows that build, test, and deploy code automatically.

**Example CI/CD Pipeline:**
1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Add a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`) with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v2
         with:
           node-version: '14'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm install

       - name: Run tests
         run: npm test
   ```

This workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests, checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

### Introduction to Visual Studio
